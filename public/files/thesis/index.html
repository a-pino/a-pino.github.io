<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Basketball is one of the most popular team sports, whose many compet-
itive, well-organized and well-recorded leagues provide rich sources of data
frequently used to analyze tactics, strategy, player performance and team
composition. A consequence of basketball’s team dynamics, comprising five
active players per team on the court who may be replaced by substitute
players on many occasions per game, is the formation of archetypes; players
are categorized into positions based on roles they play, such as point-scoring,
rebounding or defense. However, the evolution of game strategy has meant
that the three traditional positions, namely—guard, forward, and center, are
no longer sufficient to completely describe roles of players within the team.</p>
<p>Understanding the archetypes of basketball players offers an advantage to
teams in strategizing against their opponents, and finding and fixing weak-
nesses in their team composition, whether by adding skills to current players
or recruiting new talent. Usually a matter of subjective observation, espe-
cially in non-professional leagues such as the collegiate University Athletics
Association of the Philippines (UAAP), we undertake the task of finding
groups of players who fit in certain positions or archetypes more objectively
with mathematical techniques from topological data analysis (TDA).</p>
<p>We use numerical data measuring player performance during the 84th
season of the UAAP basketball tournament, with a high number of fea-
tures per player corresponding to different player actions such as points, re-
bounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, fouls and shot attempts. Using this
high-dimensional dataset as a point cloud, we use Vietoris-Rips filtration to
connect nodes representing players from progressively longer distances, dis-
covering the presence of hole complexes that imply groupings or clusters of
players. We study our dataset further using the Mapper algorithm which
applies dimensionality reduction and clustering to more prominently display
topological features as connections between nodes representing multiple play-
ers.</p>
<p>We are able to identify four subgroups of players not previously indi-
cated in the five traditional basketball positions; paint dominators, stretch
forwards, defensive rebounders, and scrappers. Furthermore, we discover two
hole structures of a much larger prominence than others in the mapper plot,
associating them with missing archetypes of players. These are three-point
plus defensive specialists, and aggressive foul-drawers, whose attributes are
currently underrepresented within the league, and thus could make a team to
strategize against. We conclude that TDA techniques can identify archetypes
of players beyond the traditional classifications and can provide advantageous
insights for basketball teams.</p>
